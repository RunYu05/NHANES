# NHANES
Explore relationship between nutrition elements intake and income using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

Health disparities are pervasive among Americans. It has been studied that individuals with higher socioeconomic status have a lower rick of having the chronic diseases. Meanwhile, Diet has been known as a contributor of the chronic diseases. Dietary preferences have changed in recent decades with trends of the healthy diet in order to prevent the chronic diseases. However, a healthier diet requires higher cost since added sugar and fat are more affordable. As a result, socioeconomic disparities in diet occur. The purpose of this study is to 1) discuss the relationship between the income and the intake of five nutrition elements including sugar, fiber, fat, carbohydrate and protein, 2) examine which nutrition elements intake is affected by the income, 3) help create comprehensive strategies to reduce problematic dietary patterns among all sociodemographic groups in the United States.
